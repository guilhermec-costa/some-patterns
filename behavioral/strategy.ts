/*

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, 
put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable

Strategy defines different approaches that can be used to reach the same goal, with the same object,
interchangebly, via a common strategy interface

routing system analogy:
Each time you added a new routing algorithm, 
the main class of the navigator doubled in size. At some point, the beast became too hard to maintain.

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific 
in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called strategies.
